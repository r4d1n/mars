# nasa-mars-photos

####There are two parts to this project:

A **scraper** for saving photos and metadata from the NASA API to my own S3 bucket and Postgres instance and a **web app** for browsing through the images.

The scraper is currently deployed and doing its thing on an EC2 instance, but the app is a work in progress.
