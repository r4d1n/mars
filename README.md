# nasa-mars-photos

####There are two parts to this project:

A scraper for saving photos and metadata from the NASA API to my own S3 bucket and Postgres instance
A web app for browsing the images

The scraper is currently deployed on a small EC2 instance, but the app is very much a work in progress still.
I hope to have a prototype online soon!
